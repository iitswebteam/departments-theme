All features implemented on dev/sociology and dev/athleticsalumni.

1. image crop: most sites already have this

2. multi upload for photo gallery + implement helper text
	- enable modules: Multiupload Filefield Widget, ultiupload Imagefield Widget
	- adjust photo gallery content type: image field widget should change to ‘multiupload’
	- edit the image field help text so content creators, know how to upload multiple images

3. image upload server processing allows automatic image resize.
	- enable modules: ImageAPI Optimize
	- adjust image fields in every content type: take out the limit in kb. Implement a maximum size in pixels. I chose something a bit larger than what we need.
	- configure ImageAPI under Configuration > Media as per CMS > Image Toolkit
	-Select ImageAPI Optimize

4. remove extra spacing generated by empty views blocks being rendered.
	- Problem: empty blocks generated by views are still being generated, and given the padding we have in the styling, we’re getting unwanted spacing. So far I detected 2 blocks that create this problem.
	- Solution: Update ‘static banner’ and ‘video display’ views adding a ‘content not empty’ condition in the filter criteria section.

5. remove select list feature for superfish affecting tablet layout, and allow the menu to collapse for small screens
	- Problem: menu converts into a dropdown list for tablet layout
	- Solution: Visit: Blocks > Superfish 1 block: Under ’sf-smallscreen’ menu select ‘disable’. ‘Advanced CSS settings’ > ‘Custom Classes’ - add class for main UL: departmental-menu
	- Configuration > Superfish > remove the superfish library: sites/all/libraries/superfish/sfsmallscreen.js (bottom line).

6. drag and drop feature for banners + implement helper block and interface
	- Problem: allow content editors to re-order homepage banners by simply dragging them.
	- enable module: Draggableviews
	- content type adjustment: Slideshow banner - remove the ‘weight’ field. Add a note about the change affecting the content type. (copy and paste from Edit > description)
	- views: import ‘Slideshow order’ view
	- views: adjust ‘Slideshow Banner’ view: under sort criteria section: remove ‘weight’ field, and add ‘Draggableviews: weight’. Leave options as default.
	- create block: ‘Re-order slides’ to be displaied on homepage only, select ‘Help’ region, and restrict roles to editor or admin.
	- give permission to editors to access DraggableViews
	
	
7. summary image for page content type (involves teaser template upgrade) + implement helper text
	- Problem: Some images used as static banner for page content type, are not suitable to be displaied as a thumbnail in a teaser view. That’s when ‘summary image’ can be used. (node--teaser.tpl.php needs to be updated for ‘departments’ theme, for this to work)
	- add ‘Summary Image’ field into page content type as per CMS.
	- Under manage display > Teaser update the display of images accordingly.

8. adaptive images (banners)
	- enable module: Client-side adaptive images
	- add image styles for smaller screens: banner-tablet & banner-mobile:
		banner-tablet: —> Scale and crop 600x240
		banner-mobile: —> Crop 480x240
	- views > slideshow banner > banner image field: formatter change to ‘Adaptive Image’. Set values for tablet and mobile coresponding to the image styles created. Also, select maximum and fallback values (the original styles chosen for desktop)
	- repeat process for static banner view.
- slideshow banner view needs updating so the bullets have a background colour, even when there is no text information. The banner field needs re-writing to generate an empty div, that will serve as the blue container for the bullets.

9. review CK Editor image features making sure they are consistent

10. make sure the breadcrumbs work properly: include Home in the path and current page is not a link. Breadcrumbs should show everywhere except homepage. To fix go to: Appearance > theme settings > breadcrumbs > tick ‘Show the homepage link’

11. Change Employment display from Quicktabs to regular views.
	- copy view ‘All Jobs Postings’ (No QUicktabs)
	- remove the old view, views blocks and uninstall Quicktabs module
	- only add the parent views blocks, not the attachement views blocks, attachements get pinned automatically. 
	- add the appropriate titles to blocks
	- create ‘Exclusion Equivalent Courses’ block where needed, and create a page to link to with the right info as per CMS

12. Gallery update: add class “gallery” in context and add class “gallery_active” in the main menu ‘Gallery’ link attribute. Create gallery album, and add albums to it, so the breadcrub is accurate. (see SEEC dev for an accurate example)

13. social media block has been changed from management. Please see dsl beta. I’ve created a view, and added a class, to help with theming. Mgmt used a block with a theme automatically generated id for themeing, which was impossible to re-use.

14. Update to conditional fields for all content types where possible.

15. Employment update: same as for gallery, we want to see the highlited link when looking at independent employment pages. See sustainability.

16. Add TPASC and EV buildings in people content type (see admissions)
17. Add teaser thumbnail style for portrait style (as per athletics)
18. FAQ view: make sure body text is formatted as default instead of ‘plain text’
19. Add person-normal image style for regular size image for people detail display 200x264 as per sustainability or athleticsalumni
20. Add re-order albums feature for Gallery
21. News & Events feature allows articles to be submitted automatically under the corespondent menu via Context (athletics alumni)
